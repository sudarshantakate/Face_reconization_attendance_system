Introduction 

The main objectives of an IoT-based smart attendance system using AI are multifaceted, aiming to revolutionize the traditional methods of attendance tracking in various contexts. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, these systems strive to achieve automated attendance tracking, eliminating the need for manual marking while ensuring accuracy and reliability. Real-time monitoring capabilities facilitated by IoT sensors enable instantaneous updates, enhancing the timeliness and efficiency of attendance management. Moreover, the integration of AI algorithms not only minimizes errors but also reduces the reliance on manual intervention, thereby optimizing resources and streamlining administrative processes. Security concerns are addressed through advanced features such as facial recognition and biometric authentication, safeguarding against unauthorized access and fraudulent attendance marking. Furthermore, the utilization of AI enables comprehensive data analysis, unlocking valuable insights from attendance patterns and trends to inform decision-making and resource allocation strategies. Together, these objectives underscore the transformative potential of IoT-based smart attendance systems, poised to redefine how attendance is monitored and managed across various domains.
